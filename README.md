# Wall Run
This is a simple game written in Python 3 for up to six players. 
This repository contains all needed python files beside the necessary packages.

For now, there is no stand-alone version of this game so you have to run the \_\_main\_\_.py method.

## Needed Packages
In order to run this game you need the following packages:
- numpy (>=1.19.1)
- time
- timeit
- threading
- pynput (>=1.6.8)
- tkinter

A detailed requirements list of the single needed functions from the list might follow 
later when a setup file is made.
